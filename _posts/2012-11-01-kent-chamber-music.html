			<p>The series consisted of six concerts produced by a musical organization in a small town, where advertising is done through shop-window fliers and word of mouth. I wanted to create six unique posters that look like part of a set, represent chamber music's classical elegance, and when placed in a shop window, stand out from the busy fliers next to them. Attendance greatly increased from the previous years.</p>
